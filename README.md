# 🤖 AK Bot – AI Chatbot using OpenAI & Streamlit

## 📌 Project Overview
**AK Bot** is an interactive AI-powered chatbot built using **Streamlit** and **OpenAI’s GPT model**.  
It provides a conversational interface where users can ask questions and receive intelligent, context-aware responses in real time.

The chatbot maintains conversation history during a session, creating a smooth and natural chat experience.

## 🎯 Objective
The goal of this project is to:
- Build a simple yet powerful AI chatbot
- Integrate OpenAI’s language models with a web interface
- Demonstrate session-based conversation handling
- Enable real-time streaming responses for better UX

---

## 🧠 AI Model Used
- **Model:** OpenAI GPT (configurable, default set to GPT-4)
- **Capabilities:**
  - Natural language understanding
  - Context-aware responses
  - Multi-turn conversations
  - Human-like interaction

The model selection is stored in session state, allowing flexibility for future upgrades.

---

## 🖥️ Web Interface (Streamlit)
The chatbot interface is created using **Streamlit’s chat components**, providing a clean and intuitive UI.

### ✨ Key UI Features
- Chat-style message bubbles
- Persistent conversation history during session
- User input via chat input box
- Real-time streamed responses from OpenAI
- Minimal and responsive design

---

## 🔄 How It Works
1. User enters a message in the chat input
2. Message is stored in Streamlit session state
3. Entire conversation history is sent to OpenAI
4. OpenAI generates a response using the selected model
5. Response is streamed live to the UI
6. Assistant reply is added back to the session

This ensures **context retention** across the conversation.
